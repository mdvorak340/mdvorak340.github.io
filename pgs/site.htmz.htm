  I have always disliked using <a href="./pgs/site.htmz.javascript.htm#javascript">frameworks</a>
  <span id="javascript"></span>
</p>
<p>
  but, i was looking at <a target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>…
  maybe i even snuck a surreptitious glance or two at
  <a target="_blank" href="https://hyperscript.org/"><code>_hyperscript</code></a>… and i
  started to get that hunger again
</p>
<p>
  i ended up reading through the htmx website when i stumbled upon a great
  jewel:  <a target="_blank" href="https://leanrada.com/htmz/">htmz</a>
<p>
  you see, the problem with htmx is that it is simply too large.  15.7 kB?!?
  that is like, the size of this html file.  no, htmz is a much more
  respectable 166 bytes.  that is smaller than this paragraph of text
</p>
<p>
  how does it do it?
  well, htmz is a hidden <code>&lt;iframe/&gt;</code> set up
  so that — whenever it loads
  a page — it copies itself into a container in the parent document.  so if
  you ever try to open a link with that <code>iframe</code> as the target, it
  instead overwrites some other part of the page with the content of that
  link
</p>
<p>
  it misuses anchor tags and form actions to load content, it
  entirely abuses URL hashes for container selection, it <em>literally consists
  of a hidden second page that copies itself wholesale into the main page
  every time it is used</em> — it is perfect
</p>
<p>
  even once you think you have gotten a handle on it, it continues to be
  fucked in subtle ways that result in so many opportunities to implement fun
  and unique solutions

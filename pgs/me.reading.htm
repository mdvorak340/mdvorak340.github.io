    As a bonus, here are some less well-known works that I loved!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <cite>Foundryside</cite> by Robert Jackson Bennett.  Fantasy
      trilogy with one my fav magic systems and the greatest middle-distance friend
      to ever grace the page:  Clef.  LOVED the first book; the last two were fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      <cite>Velocity Weapon</cite> by Megan E. O'Keefe.  Hefty sci-fi trilogy
      with solid characters and another great middle-distance friend.
      Good read all around.
    </li>
    <li><cite>Time To Orbit: Unknown</cite> by Derin Edala.  Web serial that was
      self-published as a duology; it contains a normal spaceship crewed by
      some normal people and nothing ever goes wrong. Ever.

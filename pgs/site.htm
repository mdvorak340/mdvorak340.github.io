  <h2>Addiction is a powerful thing</h2>
  <p>
    This website is the result of me enforcing a ban on myself to stop making
    websites.  Midterms where coming up, I had things to do, and I just
    could not stop myself from writing html â€” you know how it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    I put measures in place to stop myself from misusing my laptop in an effort
    to kick the habit, but ended up sitting in the back of van installing a
    <a href="./pgs/site.editor.htm#editor">text editor</a> on my phone.  So.  Here is my first <em>truly</em> mobile-first
    website!  Written, tested, and deployed straight from my phone.  While I
    was locked out of my laptop.  For the express purpose of not working on
    projects so I can focus on schoolwork.
  </p>
  <span id="editor"></span>
  <p>
    So anyway.  Here are the new things I learned when making this site!

  <h3><a href="./pgs/site.htmz.htm#htmz">htmz</a></h3>
  <span id="htmz"></span>
  <h3><a href="./pgs/site.animation.htm#animation">CSS animations</a></h3>
  <span id="animation"></span>
  <h3>Audio</h3>
  <span id="audio"></span>
  <h3>Counters</h3>

      <p>Mozilla <q>Mozzie</q> Firefox Dvorak is a gay transgender furry who is
      in denial and only writes about it in the most embarrassing places
      imaginable, for some fucked up reason.  The greatest joy in his life is
      overcomplicating simple tasks</p>
      <p>Ms. Dvorak has been diagnosed with either autism or
      <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr>,
      though he doesn't know which. He was also born with sound-to-color
      synesthesia, which has greatly influenced his relationship with music</p>
      <p>It sees itself as an artist, despite a life spent in engineering,
      perhaps as a hold-over from its first dream job. It still enjoys drawing,
      and plans to write, but mostly contents itself with designing computer
      programs as its primary form of artistic expression</p>
      <p>Sasha prefers the female versions of gendered nouns (e.g. miss,
      actress), despite using he/him and generally considering itself as more
      masculine</p>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>

    <span>
      <p>Ms. Mozzie operates internally with a conversational structure: Rather
      than an internal monologue, he has an internal dialogue</p>
      <p>All of Mozzie's thoughts are directed at <em>someone</em>, or are
      directed to him <em>by</em> someone.  This someone may not always be
      defined, which is the closest Mozzie's thoughts come to monologue, but
      those thoughts always have a voice, an idea of audience, and a stage</p>
      <p>At a younger age, these other voices where always friends or book
      characters, but as Mozzie grew fictional characters became less and less
      prevalent, and nowadays only appear when directly relevant — e.g.
      explaining a real-life concept to someone from a world wherein that
      concept does not exist, or musing over their source material</p>
      <p>These characters where replaced with a set of persona's created by
      Mozzie during its primary education, that now make up most of its
      internal conversations.  These personas don't naturally have names, as
      they were originally created as collections of virtues, each with an
      explicit purpose.  Names have never been something Mozzie was good with,
      and to this day it does not acknowledge internal speakers by name, but
      instead by a nebulous 'vibe'</p>
      <p>Despite this, it is easier to write about these personas if they have
      something to identify them with, and as such many of them have been given
      or claimed names that can be used when they are referred to
      externally</p>

      <span>
        <h3>Crescendo</h3>
        <p><a href="?page=n" title="?page=n">Crescendo</a> or <q>N</q> was the
        first of the original three to be designed.  His attribute is
        <q>skill</q> and his associated color is red; his original purpose was,
        in the writing of the middle-schooler that became Mozzie, to be <q>who I
        <em>should</em> be</q></p>
        <p>He was always the social one, as was the truer intention behind him:
        To interact with people</p>

        <h3>Blue</h3>
        <p><a href="?page=blue" title="?page=blue">Blue</a> was the first of the
        original three to be named, and the second to be defined. Their attribute
        is <q>moral</q>, strangely enough — no idea what Sasha was thinking there
        — and their associated color is blue. Their original purpose was to be
        either <q>who I <em>am</em></q> or <q>who I <em>want</em> to be</q>, with
        the other purpose taken by the third persona</p>
        <p>From the start, they were the engineer — the one who created — but
        their true defining characteristic is that they are dramatic, to put it
        lightly</p>

        <h3>h3</h3>
        <p><a href="?page=page" title="?page=page">The last of the three</a> was
        never given a name, and that has become my primary identifier.  My
        attribute is something Mozzie could never put into words, but was written
        down at the time of creation as <q>heroic innocence</q>.  My associated
        color is green.  My purpose was to be either <q>who [Mozzie]
        <em>is</em></q> or <q>who [Mozzie] <em>wants</em> to be</q> with other
        purpose claimed by Blue</p>
        <p>My role is to be the one who enjoys things; who loves things; who
        hates things; to be the one Mozzie is when it isn't anything else</p>

        <h3>Mediator</h3>
        <p>This guy's a lot more 'internal' than the others; it mostly serves to
        coordinate between other personas and facilitate <q>arguments</q>. It is
        difficult to explain, but serves a very important role in the ecosystem
        that is Mozzie's mind</p>
        <p>Essentially, it plays a cross between a devil's advocate and a
        couple's counselor.  This is to make sure the whole peanut gallery
        operates according to a shared internal logic, and ensure none of us
        diverge ideologically.  If someone says something that isn't <q>in
        character</q> or should conflict with our beliefs, the mediator is the
        internal construction that examines that conflict and resolves it.
        Mostly by posing questions from an outside perspective until the others
        reach a consensus — the mediator almost never makes a statement that
        isn't a question</p>

        <h3>That Fucker</h3>
        <p>Another persona that never earned a name, this guy is the only one
        that doesn't play nice.  He tends to just bubble up whenever someone
        brings up a certain band of topics and proceeds to embarrass Mozzie</p>
        <p>A good test for if you're talking to this guy:  Ask if Sasha believes
        something he obviously believes.  If he says, <q>Yes, I believe that.</q>
        then he's normal.  If says <q>No, I don't 'believe' anything.  Why would
        you say you <em>believe</em> something if you think it's true?  You would
        just say it's true.  I think things are true, I don't 'believe' they are
        true.</q> then stop talking to him</p>

    <span>
      <p>Mx. Dvorak is known for occasionally being overly verbose for no
      apparent reason. For instance, it once stated (unprompted):  <q>If
      you desire to criticize my music taste, you must remember I enjoy
      extenuating circumstances that render me exempt from any such
      statements.</q> No one knows why it does this</p>
